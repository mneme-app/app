## What's in a Name? ü§î

It's a web application and API designed to revolutionize how you interact with knowledge. You can submit, store, and retrieve a wealth of learning materials in a seamlessly organized database. Dive into articles, news reports, official documents, scientific papers, and more. And don't forget those handy notes that distill complex information into bite-sized chunks. Mneme empowers you with diverse quiz questions and prompts to put your knowledge to the test.

## Aesthetic and Performance üé®

Mneme takes care of both aesthetics and performance. We use [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and load the sleek Inter font, providing a delightful reading experience.

## The API World üåê

Mneme is a unified platform that serves both the website and the API. Currently, we offer multiple API endpoints and HTTP verbs for updating the database through the API. To set up your personal system, you'll need the URI of a MongoDB database. You can either run a local instance or follow our instructions in the "sample.env" file to configure the URI.


## Our Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

Our journey ahead involves creating three essential API endpoints, each corresponding to distinct Mongoose models. Here's a glimpse of where Mneme is headed:

- **Source Model**: We're introducing a dedicated model for linking reliable sources of subject-related information for study.
- **Note Model**: Expect a model that supports concise summaries or explanations drawn from multiple sources, enhancing note reliability.
- **Quiz Model**: Dive into versatile question formats, including prompt/response, fill-in-the-blank, ordered or unordered lists, and more. We're even exploring multimedia prompts with WCAG-compliant text alternatives.

Join us on this thrilling journey to reshape learning and knowledge sharing with Mneme!
